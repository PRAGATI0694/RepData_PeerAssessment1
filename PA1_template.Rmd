## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo = TRUE}
 data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, include=TRUE}
total_steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(total_steps, breaks = 30, xlab = "total number of steps taken each day", col ="yellow" , border = "black")

mean(total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)

median(total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
averages <- aggregate(x = list(steps = data$steps), by = list(interval = data$interval), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot(data = averages, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) + geom_line(col = "red", lwd = 1) + xlab("5-minute interval") + 
    ylab("average number of steps taken in a day")
```


## Imputing missing values
```{r echo = TRUE}
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r echo = TRUE}
```
